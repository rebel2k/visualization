### Organization
To help you locate relevant visualizations in the library, the following naming convention has been adopted.
1. `Type` - `Answer` or `Liveboard`
2. `Scope` - Examples include `Global`, `On-Prem`, `Cloud`, `k8s`, etc.
3. `Short Description` - A short title describing the visualization.

Clicking into a directory will expose a `readme.md` file and `.tml` file. The `readme.md` file contains a screenshot of the visualization so you can see an example.
